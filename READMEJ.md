<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
### Description
A first foray into the backend, made during my time as a trainee software engineer at the Digital Futures Training Academy. We learned about this in less than a week, whilst simultaneously working on serveral other things. I had previously written some rock, paper, scissors code which I was able to refactor and make more concise, due to my now much more advanced knowledge and experience. That code can be found here - https://github.com/JacDoesJS/rock-paper.git


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project
I was tasked with providing a Rock, Paper, Scissors game to play on the web, with the following user stories: 

(DFAT - Digital Futures Academy team member)  
<br>

### User Stories
```
As a DFAT member
So that I can see my name
I would like to register my name before playing an online game
```
1a test that server is connected  

1b test that player name is added

<br>

```
As a DFAT member
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```
2a test that each button registers the correct weapon  

2b test that player's weapon choice is stored  

2c test that computer weapon random choice method is called  
<br>

3a test that the result is a draw when both choose the same weapon  

3b test that a win is returned when appropriate  

3c test that a different win scenario follows the game rules  
<br>

4a test a POST request on the game route  

4b test a GET request on the game route  

4c test a POST request on the winner route  

4d test a GET request on the winner route  

4e test a POST request on the again route  

4f test a GET request on the again route  

<br>

Hints on functionality

- the DFAT member should be able to enter their name before the game
- the DFAT member will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the DFAT member can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

<br>

## Review  

As ever, I really want to do more of this. Coming from a music background, I know only too well that practice builds skills and confidence. We are moving onto a full-stack project next so I will get the chance to attach frontend React components and a database to this new backend knowledge. 

It was fun to upgrade the game to include lizard and Spock (see accreditation below). This project didn't have a frontend focus but I would have liked to have had the time to make the user interface more aesthetically pleasing. It would be good to make it into a 2-player game, with a scoring system.  

Am array of win conditions would help to reduce long checkWinner() function in the Battle class.

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments
</br>

Thanks to...

* Extra thanks to Lucas Changas for helping me to understand the sequence of events: you render a page, the user inputs some data, a little worker takes that data and prepares it (and maybe stores some of it in locals), and sends it on a route, and then uses it to render a new page, and repeat... Lucas is a great coach and I am hugely thankful he could help me to fix my code, as this was the first time I had done anything like this.  
  
* Thanks to Simon Cobb at 13th on the left Productions Limited for his ongoing support and many words of wisdom about JavaScript.

* my wonderfully supportive cohort - thanks for all those thoughtful little messages of encouragement. We are nearly at the end of this amazing ride through the academy.
